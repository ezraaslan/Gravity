# Gravity is a difficult but rewarding platforming game about a lost astronaut on a journey to find his spaceship and return to planet Earth. Sadly, his jetpack has lost all its fuel and the only way to guide him home is to manipulate the gravitational field around him with the one of a kind Grav-o-Ball (patent pending). Along the way, encounter friends, foes, and other deep spaces oddities -- but be sure to have fun! 

Controls: Use the mouse to drag the Grav-o-Ball around. The gravity is strongest at its center and only exists within its circumference, so be sure to keep the player inside the ball. Navigate around asteroids and find the portal to go to the next level. To pause/unpause the game, press the esc key. Click the house button that appears while paused to exit to the level selection screen and hit the quit button from there to exit the application.

A note for the ship certification - the demo download has always worked for me so I do not know why it didn't for you the first time I shipped the project. Make sure you are clicking the "begin journey" button on the start page so it doesn't get get stuck there like you wrote.

Edit: I think I have fixed the viewport settings so that it will display the full title screen and allow you to proceed through the game. Please let me know if it still does not work.
